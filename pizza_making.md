# A few experimentations with pizza making

_Note: all recipes, unless otherwise specified, are cooked on a 2,5cm thick pizza stone, in a normal, up to 220°, oven. A leaven like "lievito madre" is used_

## Ingredients for 2 medium/large pizza

* 400gr flour
* 260ml water
* 8gr sugar (optional)
* 10gr salt
* 100gr levain (or 15gr of yeast)
* 15ml olive oil (optional)

### For the sauce

Depending on how many pizza you're making, the quantities vary. Use tomato sauce with some crushed tomatoes. Leave the seeds in.

Make the sauce with a classic "soffritto" of garlic and extravirgin olive oil. Discard the garlic when brown. Then pour all the sauce and tomatoes, crush those while in the pan. Add some warm water, salt, pepper. Let it cook very slow until it shows no signs of water and is a mostly dense sauce.

## Instructions

In mixing bowl, mix together flour, sugar, levain (or yeast).

Melt salt in tiepid/warm water.

While mixing with flat paddle, slowly pour the water into dry mixture.

Let stand for 5 minutes (allows yeast to interact with water).

Hand knead until combined. Add olive oil. Roll into a ball.

Place in a covered bowl, in a warm place (22-23°C at least) for a couple of hours. Don't let it dry, knead it every 30-45 minutes if it tends to drying.

After that, work the dough by stretching it, pulling it over the center, rotating 90° and stretching again. Do this until the stretching starts to lacerate the dough. Then stop.

Let it sit for 2 more hours. Repeat the stretching and pulling. Let it rest for about 30 minutes. Separate into multiple balls (2 or more depending on how many pizza are desired).

Then put in the fridge overnight, at least. Up to 48 hours, 24-36 being ideal.

Before preparing the pizza, leave from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 2-6 hours. As long as it is still growing and the exterior isn't drying up.

Pre-heat the pizza stone at max oven temperature (not grill) for at least half an hour. Depending on how thick the stone is and its material, you may need to prolong this preheating to up to 1 full hour.

Then flat the dough out and prepare the pizza. Use the tomato sauce as instructed above or any type of sauce you like. Pour a spoon of extravirgin olive oil on the sauce.

The overall cooking of the pizza depends on the temperature of your oven and how hot is the pizza stone. Without a pizza stone, on a typical oven baking sheet, it may need up to 20 minutes to fully cook. That's not a neapolitan pizza though, which does require short cooking times and high temperatures. On a pizza stone 7-10 minutes should be sufficient.

Add fior di latte, if available, or fresh mozzarella 2-3 minutes before pulling the pizza out of the oven. Fresh basil leaves can be added too, 1 minute before ending the cooking or directly before serving. Make sure the leaves don't burn as they will become bitter.
