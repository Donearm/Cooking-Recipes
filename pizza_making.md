# Looking for the "perfect" pizza

_Note: all recipes, unless otherwise specified, are cooked on a 2,5cm thick pizza stone, in a normal, up to 220°, oven. A leaven like "lievito madre" is used_

## Recipe n1

### Ingredients for 2 medium/large pizza

* 400g flour
* 260ml water
* 8g sugar (optional)
* 10g salt
* 100g levain (or 15gr of yeast)
* 15ml olive oil (optional)

#### For the sauce

Depending on how many pizza you're making, the quantities vary. Use tomato sauce with some crushed tomatoes. Leave the seeds in.

Make the sauce with a classic "soffritto" of garlic and extravirgin olive oil. Discard the garlic when brown. Then pour all the sauce and tomatoes, crush those while in the pan. Add some warm water, salt, pepper. Let it cook very slow until it shows no signs of water and is a mostly dense sauce.

### Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, mix together flour, sugar, levain (or yeast).
2. Melt salt in tiepid/warm water.
3. While mixing with flat paddle, slowly pour the water into dry mixture.
4. Let stand for 5 minutes (allows yeast to interact with water).
5. Hand knead until combined. Add olive oil. Roll into a ball.
6. Place in a covered bowl, in a warm place (22-23°C at least) for a couple of hours. Don't let it dry, knead it every 30-45 minutes if it tends to drying.
7. After that, work the dough by stretching it, pulling it over the center, rotating 90° and stretching again. Do this until the stretching starts to lacerate the dough. Then stop.
8. Let it sit for 2 more hours. Repeat the stretching and pulling. Let it rest for about 30 minutes. Separate into multiple balls (2 or more depending on how many pizza are desired).
9. Then put in the fridge overnight, at least. Up to 48 hours, 24-36 being ideal.
10. Before preparing the pizza, leave from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 2-6 hours. As long as it is still growing and the exterior isn't drying up.
11. Pre-heat the pizza stone at max oven temperature (not grill) for at least half an hour. Depending on how thick the stone is and its material, you may need to prolong this preheating to up to 1 full hour.
12. Then flat the dough out and prepare the pizza. Use the tomato sauce as instructed above or any type of sauce you like. Pour a spoon of extravirgin olive oil on the sauce.
13. The overall cooking of the pizza depends on the temperature of your oven and how hot is the pizza stone. Without a pizza stone, on a typical oven baking sheet, it may need up to 20 minutes to fully cook. That's not a neapolitan pizza though, which does require short cooking times and high temperatures. On a pizza stone 7-10 minutes should be sufficient.
14. Add fior di latte, if available, or fresh mozzarella 2-3 minutes before pulling the pizza out of the oven. Fresh basil leaves can be added too, 1 minute before ending the cooking or directly before serving. Make sure the leaves don't burn as they will become bitter.

## Recipe with TangZhong/Water Roux

This recipe yields for 2 pizzas of 250g. The pizza dough is made with a TangZhon, also know as water roux or Mehlkochstück (in German). Dough made with a TangZhong leads to a juicier, fluffier crumb and a longer freshness.

### Ingredients for the TangZhong/Water Roux

* 100g flour
* 500g water

### Preparation of the TangZhong/Water Roux

1. Combine the flour with the water and whisk until there are no lumps left.
2. Heat it on medium fire while stirring/whisking continuously.
3. Around 65-67°C it starts to thicken. Turn off the heat and keep stirring/whisking for another 1-3 minutes.
4. Let the TangZhong rest for at least 3 hours.

### Ingredients for the main dough

* 100g flour
* 57,54g water
* 17,54g TangZhong
* 2,89g salt
* 0,32g fresh yeast

### Preparation of the main dough

1. Dissolve the yeast in the water and add the flour together with the TangZhong in another bowl.
2. When the yeast is dissolved, add the fine salt and give it a good mix.
3. Add the liquid to the dry flour and TangZhong and knead until everything until it is combined and there are no lumps left. This will take around 3-5 minutes and it's okay that the dough hasn't a smooth surface at this stage.
4. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.
5. Now comes the "stretch and fold" stage. Grab one side from the bottom of the pizza dough, pull it to the middle and tuck it in there. Turn the bowl by 60° to 90° and repeat. After a while, you will notice, that the pizza dough starts to build up tension and eventually the surface will tear up. Stop there, cover the bowl again and let the pizza dough rest again for 30 minutes.
6. Repeat the previous step at least twice.
7. After the last stretch and fold, let the pizza dough rest again (30 min) before balling it. Otherwise, you will tear the pizza dough when balling if it's unrelaxed.
8. Ball your dough, place them in a suitable container and let them rest.

### Proofing steps and protocol

1. 3 hours at 23°C (balled)
2. 19 hours at 8°C (balled)
3. 1,5 hours at 22°C (balled)

The dough had a temperature of 19°C when shaped.

### Baking

Use a gas-fired pizza oven as the Roccbox. Floor temperature 450C in the back and 420C in the middle.
