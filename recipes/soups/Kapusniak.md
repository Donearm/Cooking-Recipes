Kapuśniak (also known as 'Polish Cabbage Soup' or 'Kapusta Soup') is a Polish 
classic. Soft pieces of tangy sauerkraut mingle with carrots, potatoes, and 
smokey bacon for a bowl of soul-soothing comfort. 

Ingredients
===========

* 450gr pork ribs
* 3-4 smoked pork bones (optional)
* 2 tbsp canola oil
* 1 medium white onion
* ½ leek
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 tbsp dried marjoram
* ½ tsp caraway seeds
* 2 medium carrots
* ⅓ celery root
* 1 parsley root
* 4 bay leaves
* 6 allspice berries
* 2l water
* 3 medium potatoes
* 300gr sauerkraut (make sure it wasn’t soured with vinegar!)
* Salt, to taste
* Ground black pepper, to taste
* 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped

Preparation
===========

1. Divide the ribs into smaller pieces, ideally of such a size that they fit 
   easily in the soup plate. Season them with salt and pepper. 
2. Grab a frying pan and heat up 2 tablespoons of canola oil. Fry them on each 
   side until they start to turn golden. Moved these fried ribs into a pot 
   (ideally sized at 3 qt / 3 litres or bigger). Don’t wash the frying pan just 
   yet!
3. Chop the leek and dice the onion finely. Fry these veggies on the fat that 
   remained from frying ribs. At the end of frying, add crushed garlic clove 
   and spices: one tablespoon of dried marjoram and half a teaspoon of caraway 
   seeds. When heated, the spices release their essential oils, giving 
   Kapuśniak its unique taste. Put the fried ingredients aside for now.
4. Peel the vegetables (2 carrots, a parsley root and a chunk of a celery 
   root). Dice them into squares (roughly with half-inch/1 cm sides). Drop them 
   into the pot with ribs. Add 4 bay leaves and 6 allspice berries. Then, pour 
   2 quarts (around 2 litres) of water.
5. Cook for 30 minutes on low heat, until both ribs and vegetables soften.
6. Peel and cube the potatoes, add them to the soup and continue cooking until 
   they soften (that takes around 15 minutes)
7. As you wait, drain the sauerkraut (keep the juices!) and chop it roughly. 
   Add them to the soup, together with the onion, leek and spices we have fried 
   before.
8. Continue cooking on a low heat for a further 30 minutes, in that time the 
   sauerkraut will soften and release its aromas.
9. Have a taste. Season with salt and pepper. If Kapuśniak needs more sour 
   ‘kick’, add some leftover sauerkraut juice.
10. Pour the soup into bowls / soup plates, making sure that everyone gets some 
    veggies and meat. Sprinkle each portion with chopped parsley.
