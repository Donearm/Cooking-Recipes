‘Zupa Koperkowa’ is a Polish-style Dill Soup.

It takes less than 30 minutes to turn a bunch of dill into a delightful, fresh-tasting soup.


Ingredients
===========

* 3 medium carrots
* 1 spring onion, with large bulbs
* 1tbsp butter
* 1l stock, vegetable or meat-based, ideally homemade
* 100gr white rice, uncooked
* ½tsp salt
* 4tbsp heavy cream, 30% or 36% fat
* 100gr fresh dill
* ½tsp nutmeg, ground or grated
* Salt
* Black pepper
* 1 pinch of turmeric, for colour
* 1 pinch of mild paprika powder, for seasoning

Preparation
===========

1. Peel the carrots.
2. Slice carrots and onions (separated from the spring onion) into thin rounds. 
   Thinly slice the green part as well, and set aside.
3. Place the cooking pot (with a thicker base) on the stove. If you don’t own 
   one, it’s better to use a frying pan / skillet instead. Set the heat on 
   medium-low.
4. Melt a tablespoon of butter, add carrot and onion rounds with a tiny pinch 
   of salt. Fry, stirring occasionally, until the onion turns translucent.
5. Add spring onion greens and fry together for an additional 2 minutes.
6. Pour the stock in, bring to a near-boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low.
7. Add in uncooked rice and half a teaspoon of salt.
8. Partially cover the pot with a lid and cook for 15 minutes, until the rice 
   softens.
9. Pour one cup of hot soup into a bowl (avoiding the rice), and add in 4 
   tablespoons of heavy cream. Blend together with a fork or spoon, and return 
   to the pot.
10. Chop fresh dill finely, leaving some leaves aside for garnish. Add chopped 
    dill and sliced spring onion greens into the soup, stir them in.
11. Season the soup with half a teaspoon of nutmeg, a pinch of turmeric and 
    mild paprika powder, as well as a generous pinch of freshly ground black 
    pepper.
12. Stir and cook together for a further 3-4 minutes, letting the flavours 
    combine.
13. Have a taste. Does it need more salt or pepper? If so, season the soup a 
    bit more.
14. Garnish with leftover chopped dill and serve.
