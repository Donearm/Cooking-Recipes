Zupa Chrzanowa is a zingy, sharply piquant horseradish soup; balanced with calming, velvety heavy cream.

At many Polish homes, when it comes to planning an Easter menu, it’s the default choice to start the meal. Horseradish Soup wakes up your taste buds and boosts your appetite for the rest of the Easter feast. 

Garnished with an egg and fried bacon, Chrzanowa not only tastes great, but 

also looks elegant and inviting. Ingredients
===========


* 200 gr smoked bacon slab
* 2 leeks
* 2 parsley roots
* 2-3 small potatoes
* 2 medium onions
* 0.5 celeriac/celery root
* 2l water
* 1tsp marjoram
* 1 large garlic clove
* 2 dried bay leaves
* 2 allspice berries
* 4 black peppercorns, whole
* 200 ml heavy cream
* 4tbsp horseradish, grated
* Salt
* Black pepper

Preparation
===========

Frying bacon

1. Place the bacon slab into the freezer for 15-20 minutes. It will firm up a 
   bit, and therefore it will be much easier to slice.
2. Pick up a razor-sharp knife. Retrieve the bacon slab from the freezer, cut 
   off the tough skin and dice the bacon into cubes (roughly sized at 
   0.2-0.3’’; 5-7 mm per side).
3. Place a frying pan/skillet on the stove, throw the bacon in. Fry on medium 
   heat until crispy and golden. Move the bacon pieces onto a plate lined with 
   paper towel, but don’t clean the frying pan just yet.

Brewing stock

1. Rinse, peel and chop all of the vegetables finely, cube the potatoes as 
   well. Once you’re done, keep the potatoes aside (we’ll need them later, for 
   step 1 of the 'Finishing touches').
2. Drop the veggies (minus the potatoes) into the frying pan (the one we used 
   for frying bacon). Fry on medium heat for a few minutes.
3. Move the vegetables into a cooking pot, pour the water in. Add 1 teaspoon of 
   marjoram, 2 dried bay leaves, 2 allspice berries and 4 black peppercorns. 
   Cook for 30 minutes, until the vegetables have softened.

Finishing touches

1. Fish out bay leaves, allspice berries and peppercorns. Add cubed potatoes 
   and cook for another 20 minutes, until the potatoes soften. Next, blend the 
   soup with an immersion blender until smooth.
2. In a small bowl or cup, stir the heavy cream together with 4 tablespoons of 
   grated horseradish and a few tablespoons of blended soup. Return the mixture 
   into the cooking pot and stir.
3. Bring the soup to a near boil, then reduce the heat. Season with two 
   generous pinches of salt and ground black pepper. Have a taste. Does your 
   soup need more horseradish or seasoning? If so, add more.
4. Serve immediately with diced fried bacon and one egg per portion - sunny 
   side up, poached or boiled & halved. Garnish with fresh marjoram, garden 
   cress or green sprouts.
