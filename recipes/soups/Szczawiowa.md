With the start of May comes the season for one very quintessentially Polish 
ingredient: sorrel. Springtime weather favours long walks through the meadows – 
and if you watch carefully, you’ll find that it grows nearly anywhere. It’s a 
forager’s dream.

Fresh sorrel leaves have a sour, zingy, slightly piquant flavour. They’re 
perfect for adding sharpness to those heavier, richer dishes that need more 
oomph.

A bunch or two can be transformed into one of our all-time favourite soups: 
Szczawiowa. Served with boiled eggs, potatoes and cream, it’s one of the 
greatest comfort foods. Sour, intense and filling – it’s the flavour of Polish 
spring.

Ingredients
===========

Soup

* 1l homemade broth; can replace with stock (meat or vegetable-based)
* 400gr fresh sorrel leaves
* 120gr fresh nettle leaves; can replace with baby spinach
* 1 medium onion
* 1.5tbsp butter
* 0.5tsp salt
* 1tsp lemon juice
* 1 pinch of black pepper
* 1tsp sugar, can replace with mild honey
* 100ml of sour cream; 12-18% fat

Garnish (optional)

* 4 medium eggs; poached, fried, hard- or soft-boiled
* 2tsp of lemon zest; grated or cut into strips
* 1tbsp fresh thyme
* 4 bacon rashers; fried and crushed

Preparation
===========

Prep work

1. Wash all leaves, pat them dry and chop them roughly.
2. Peel onion, dice it finely.

Cooking

1. In a heavy-bottomed stock pot, melt butter. Add diced onion and sauté over 
   medium heat for 5 minutes, until lightly golden.
2. Add chopped leaves with a pinch of salt, combine with a spatula. Stew under 
   a lid for around 3-5 minutes.
3. Pour broth in, stir and bring to a near-boil. Reduce the heat (so that the 
   soup just simmers), cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes.

Blending

1. [Optional] Using a slotted spoon, remove around one-fifth of the leaves and into a bowl. Set aside.
2. Blend soup with immersion blender until smooth. Alternatively, if using a 
   food processor, allow the soup to cool down first, then move it over to the 
   device's container, blend until smooth and return to the pot.
3. [Optional] If you removed one-fifth of the leaves, now it's the moment to 
   return them to the pot.

Finishing touches

1. Add 0.5 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, a pinch of ground 
   pepper and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Stir and have a taste. Is it too sour for 
   your liking? Add a touch of sugar. Is it not sour enough? Add more lemon 
   juice.
2. Bring the soup to desired temperature. Add cream and stir.
3. Pour into individual bowls or soup plates. Garnish with eggs, lemon zest, 
   fresh thyme and fried & crushed bacon. Serve immediately. 

Notes
=====

It's best to use a rich, homemade meat & vegetable broth. In our case, we used 
duck, beef, włoszczyzna, all-spice berries and lovage and turned it into a 
thick, gelatinous broth.
