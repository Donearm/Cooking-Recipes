This is based off the original recipe and James Hoffman's interpretation of it, 
but I've customized to my needs and through making it dozens of time.

Here's the recipe for 32 biscuits and 19g espresso doses

Ingredients
===========

* 56 Savoiardi biscuits. That will amount to 2 medium/large baking trays
* 440g of coffee
* ll20g of mascarpone cheese
* 14 eggs
* 220g of sugar
* 14 drops saline solution (To make saline: dissolve 5g of salt in 20g of boiling water. Store in a dropper bottle.)
* Cocoa Powder to finish

Preparation
===========

Brew 13 double shots of espresso. Or, you can do a couple of moka pots (5 cups 
of coffee each) and 4-6 shots of espresso (depending on the final amount of 
liquid you get) until you reach the coffee liquid total. For this recipe this 
is 840g of coffee, slightly less than half of it being cold water added after 
to dilute it.
Actual coffee is then 440g, and 400g water.

Allow the coffee to cool completely before using it.

Add 14 drops of saline solution to the cooled coffee liquid.

Add all egg yolks to a ziplock bag and cook, using a sous vide circulator, at 
60C for 30 minutes then cool completely. If you cannot use a sous vide, you can 
either use them raw or you can mix with the sugar and heat in a bain marie to 
70C, then quickly cool.

Mix the sugar and egg yolk using a hand mixer, or stand mixer, at a relatively 
low speed for 4 to 5 minutes. You should see the mixture increase in volume and 
begin to notably thicken.

Add the mascarpone in thirds, each time incorporating on lower speeds for 30 to 
60 seconds. It doesn't need to be flawlessly mixed.

Whip the whites. Slowly incorporate them into the mascarpone/egg cream.

Begin the assembly. Prepare your chosen tray. This recipe presumes you will do 
it in two stages.

Pour 420g of the coffee mixture in a suitable bowl. Take half the Savoiardi. 
Dunk the Savoiardi only on the non-sugared side. Then turn upside down and 
place in the tray. Repeat with all biscuits. You should have a little coffee 
left over. Starting with the last biscuits you dunked, use a pastry brush to 
add all the remaining coffee to the biscuits in the layer.

Carefully put the mascarpone mixture on top of the biscuits. It doesn't need to 
be a lot, just enough to cover the biscuits.

Add the remaining 420g of coffee to the bowl. Repeat the dunking of the 
remaining biscuits.

Add the remaining mascarpone cream.

Dust the tiramisu with cocoa powder.

Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, ideally 24.

Serve and enjoy!

**Liqueur**

The recipe has optionally a liquer added to the mixture of yolks and mascarpone 
(before incorporating the egg whites). You may add it or not, it is totally up 
to your taste. I like to pour a shot of rhum or marsala. It does very little 
for the final taste but helps to preserve the cream for longer.
