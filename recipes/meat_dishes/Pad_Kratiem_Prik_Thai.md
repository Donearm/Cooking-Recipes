Notes
=====

Chicken – You can make garlic pepper chicken breast (skinless or skin on for 
extra flavor) or opt for other boneless cuts like chicken thighs.

White pepper – Both white and black pepper are great choices. For a more 
peppery heat, use crushed black peppercorns, or opt for white pepper if you 
want to highlight the garlic flavor.
