Who doesn’t like grilled chicken? This dish is universal and everyone loves it! 
Every country, region, and even individual has  their own version of grilled 
chicken. Chicken is available all over the world, and throughout history, 
grilling has been one of the favourite methods of cooking it. 

Grilled chicken is known as ayam bakar in Indonesia. There are many varieties 
of ayam bakar, each flavoured with a unique blend of spices. Most commonly, 
such blends include sweet soy sauce, which the chicken is simmered or marinated 
in before grilling. 

This ayam bakar recipe comes from my hometown Solo, also known as Surakarta. It 
uses a lot of spices and herbs, including the beloved Javanese duo of 
Indonesian bay leaves and galangal. The flavour is rich and savoury, and it’s 
slightly sweet from the palm sugar and sweet soy sauce. The herbs make the 
chicken quite aromatic.

Simmer the chicken on low heat until all the liquid evaporates to allow the 
spices to penetrate thoroughly. After this, the chicken can also be marinated 
overnight, but this is optional. Then comes the grilling! The best way would be 
to grill the chicken over hot charcoal, but if you do not have time or energy 
to do it, a non-stick grilling pan is perfectly fine. Enjoy the grilled chicken 
with lalapan (a mix of fresh or boiled vegetables) and sambal bajak. Bring it 
over to a party and share it with friends!

coconut water is hard to obtain, plain water can be used without making it any 
less delicious.
