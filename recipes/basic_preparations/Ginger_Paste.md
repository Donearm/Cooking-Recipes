Ingredients
===========

* 450gr fresh ginger root

Preparation
===========

Break the big ginger root into smaller knobs by hand. Scrub and wash thoroughly 
for a few times under running water making sure you take off all the dirt.
Dry each piece well using paper towels and slice roughly into pieces.

Add the ginger pieces to a blender jar and process until you get a smooth 
paste. Note: Do not add water while blending. 

Notes
=====

To store the paste, place 2 to 3 tablespoons of ginger paste in a quart-sized 
freezer bag and spread it evenly to make a thin layer. You can stack up 
multiple bags and freeze them flat in the freezer. Break small pieces as 
needed. 

Freeze in reusable silicone ice cube trays. Each compartment will usually hold 
about 1 tablespoon. You can put less if you usually use less ginger in your 
cooking. This way when you are ready to cook you can pop out smaller cubes. 
Frozen ginger will be good for 2 to 3 months.

You can also refrigerate the paste in a glass jar. This paste will stay fresh 
for 3 to 4 days.
